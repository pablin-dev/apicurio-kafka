// This file contains the definition of the Duration type.
// A Duration represents a signed, fixed-length span of time represented as a
// count of seconds and fractions of seconds at nanosecond resolution. It is
// independent of any calendar and concepts like "day" or "month". It is
// related to Timestamp in that the difference between two Timestamp values is a
// Duration and it can be added or subtracted from a Timestamp. Range is
// approximately +-10,000 years.
//
// Example 1: Compute Duration from two Timestamps in pseudo code.
//
//   Timestamp start = ...;
//   Timestamp end = ...;
//   Duration duration = end - start;
//
// Example 2: Compute Timestamp from Timestamp + Duration in pseudo code.
//
//   Timestamp start = ...;
//   Duration duration = ...;
//   Timestamp end = start + duration;
//
// Example 3: Compute Duration from datetime.timedelta in Python.
//
//   td = datetime.timedelta(days=3, minutes=10)
//   duration = Duration()
//   duration.FromTimedelta(td)
//
// JSON Mapping:
// In JSON format, the Duration type is encoded as a string rather than an
// object, where the string ends in the suffix "s" (indicating seconds) and
// is preceded by the number of seconds, with nanoseconds expressed as
// fractional seconds. For example, 3 seconds with 0 nanoseconds should be
// encoded in JSON format as "3s", while 3 seconds and 1 nanosecond should
// be expressed in JSON format as "3.000000001s", and 3 seconds and 1
// microsecond should be expressed in JSON format as "3.000001s".

// # Examples
//
// Examples for valid Duration values:
//
//     "1s" - one second
//     "-1s" - one second in the past
//     "0s" - zero duration
//     "3.100ms" - 3 milliseconds and 100 microseconds
//     "3.100us" - 3 microseconds and 100 nanoseconds
//     "3.100ns" - 3 nanoseconds and 100 picoseconds

// # JSON Mapping
//
// In JSON format, the Duration type is encoded as a string rather than an
// object, where the string ends in the suffix "s" (indicating seconds) and
// is preceded by the number of seconds, with nanoseconds expressed as
// fractional seconds. For example, 3 seconds with 0 nanoseconds should be

// be expressed in JSON format as "3.000000001s", and 3 seconds and 1
// microsecond should be expressed in JSON format as "3.000001s".
//
// The seconds part of the duration can be of any size. An amount of ten
// thousand years for the seconds part will be encoded as "315576000000s".
//
// # Fields
//
// `seconds` represents the integral part of the duration in seconds.
// Must be from -315,576,000,000 to +315,576,000,000 inclusive.
//
// `nanos` represents the fractional part of the duration in nanoseconds.
// Must be from -999,999,999 to +999,999,999 inclusive.
// If `seconds` is non-zero, `nanos` must have the same sign as `seconds`.
// If `seconds` is zero, `nanos` can be zero or non-zero, with any sign.
//
